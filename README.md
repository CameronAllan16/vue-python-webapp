# Vue - Python WebApp
Hello world, this is a Vue app built with a python backend, and an SQLite database. The database quite literally isn't working or is properly connected, it just exists right now.

## Initialize the file folder
upon cloning, navigate to client directory by using 
`cd client` 
and run 
`npm install`

this will install all necessary packages

after installing, leave the client directory open

## From the already open client directory

run `npm run dev` to run the development server

## Open another terminal window
while in the 
`vue-python-webapp` 
directory, navigate to the 
`server` 
directory by using 
`cd server`


run 
`python3 app.py` 
to initialize the development backend server

## navigate to a browser and open development server

open your preferred browsing service and paste 
`http://localhost:5173` 
into the url search box at the top and then hit 
`enter`

and boom! A 'fully' functioning web interface !
