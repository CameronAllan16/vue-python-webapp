# Vue - Python WebApp
Hello world, this is a Vue app built with a python backend. Hopefully I stick to this project 

## Initialize the file folder
upone cloning, navigate to client directory by using `cd client` and run 

`npm install`

this will install all necessary packages

after installing, leave the client directory open

## From the already open client directory

run `npm run dev` to run the development server

## Open another terminal window

navigate to the server directory

and run `python3 app.py` to initialize the development server

## navigate to a browser and open development server

open your preferred browsing service and paste `http://localhost:5173` into the url search box at the top and then hit `enter`
